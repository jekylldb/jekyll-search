In 1638, Swedish settlers, colonizing north along the Delaware from the New Sweden colony, established residences in what would become Philadelphia, at a place called Wiccaco by the local Lenape tribe, meaning "pleasant place". These Swedish settlers were Lutheran. The Gloria Dei (Old Swedesâ€™) Church was completed in 1700. Colonization extended to present-day Trenton.[2]

German settlers began arriving in North America in the mid-seventeenth century. They were particularly attracted by William Penn's promise of religious freedom in the colony of Pennsylvania, and came to the Philadelphia region in significant numbers. By 1683, the German population was large enough to form communities such as Germantown (now a neighborhood in Philadelphia).[3] Many of these immigrants brought with them their Lutheran faith and formed congregations in their new homeland.
